"""Refresh gate/free_domains.txt from its two upstream open-source lists.

"Is this a professional email?" is decided by DATA, not clever code: the
gate refuses any domain present in the community-maintained reference lists
that every off-the-shelf checker (npm ``free-email-domains``, pip
``disposable-email-domains``, the Composer equivalents) wraps:

- Kikobeats/free-email-domains — webmail / free providers (gmail.com,
  yahoo.*, orange.fr, laposte.net, protonmail.com, …), HubSpot-derived;
- disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains — throwaway providers
  (mailinator.com, yopmail.com, …), the blocklist Django and friends use.

The deployment is plain SFTP + PHP (no Composer on the host), so instead of
installing a package that embeds this data, we vendor the merged data itself
and keep THIS script as the documented, repeatable way to refresh it::

    python webapp/gate/update_blocklist.py   # rewrites gate/free_domains.txt

Then rebuild (``python webapp/build.py``) and re-upload. The file stays a
plain sorted list of lowercase domains, one per line: ``auth.php`` loads it
with ``file()`` and answers membership in O(1) via a hash set.
